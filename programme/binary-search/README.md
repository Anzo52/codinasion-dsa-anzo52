## Binary Search

Taking in a sorted int array and a target return the index of the target value. Since the array is sorted we are able to compare our target value to the middle element of the array. If value matches target we can return the index otherwise we adjust the window depending on if it's less than or greater than element value.

```txt
Input  : 10 20 30 50 60 80
Target : 30

Output : 2
```
