## Binary Search

Binary search is searching algorithm with which given a sorted array it is able to search for a target by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half making use of the fact that the array is sorted and achieving much lower time complexity compared to linear search. 

```txt
Input  : 10 20 30 50 60 80
Target : 30

Output : 2
```

```txt
Time Complexity : O(Log n)
```

```txt
Space Complexity : O(1)
```
